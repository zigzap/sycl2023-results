# SYCL 2023 Survey Results

This is a little repo that provides a viewer for the results of the little demo
survey I ran at the [Software You Can Love](https://softwareyoucanlove.ca)
conference in Vancouver, in June 2023.

If you serve the checked out directory, it will show you the results.

In case you don't have a webserver handy, grab yourself a [zig master
build](https://ziglang.org/download) and run:

```shell
$ zig build run
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

Enjoy!

If you're interested about the survey questions, you can check out [the demo
app's repo](https://github.com/zigzap/sycl2023-app), build it yourself and
participate locally, all via a simple `zig build run`.
